# News

- **[2025/01/17]** ðŸŽ‰ We have released our Z1-Coder-1.5B and Z1-Coder-7B model and data through [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Z1-Coder)!

- ðŸ¤— [Z1-Coder models](https://huggingface.co/Z1-Coder)
- ðŸ¤— [Z1-Coder data](https://huggingface.co/Z1-Coder)

# Getting Started

We open source the code and scripts we used for data curation, training, and evaluation for Z1-Coder models, you can find more details in each directory.

- ``src/eval``: Evaluation for Z1-Coder. To generate our training data, we use the QwQ-32B-Preview model. we curate reasoning trajectories on code-related datasets and propose self-invoking evolving to further refine models' reasoning behaviour in code generation. 
- ``scr/train``: Training scripts for Z1-Coder. We train all the models with Fully Shard Data Parallel (FSDP) and set a global batch size to 1024 for 3 epochs using 2 NVIDIA A800-80G GPUs. We used greedy decoding for all results, with the maximum sequence length set to 1280.
We use a learning rate of 5e-5 for the two training stages.

To train Z1-Coder, we curate reasoning trajectories on code-related datasets and propose [self-invoking](https://github.com/CodeEval-Pro/CodeEval-Pro) evolving to further refine models' reasoning behaviour in code generation. 
| Model                  | Trajectory Dataset Download       | Reference                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| SFT  *stage 1*  Data   | [Z1Coder-Evol-CoT-110K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Z1-Coder/Z1Coder-Evol-CoT-110K)         |  https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM  |
| SFT  *stage 2*  Data   | [Z1Coder-SelfInvoking-CoT-20K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Z1-Coder/Z1Coder-SelfInvoking-CoT-20K)  | https://github.com/CodeEval-Pro/CodeEval-Pro                 |

We fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Coder-Base (1.5B and 7B) for two stages with two trajectory datasets, yielding Z1-Coder-1.5B and Z1-Coder-7B respectively.

# Evaluation
Z1-Coder significantly outperforms other open-source models on different code generation benchmarks at a similar parameter size. Notably, Z1-Coder-7B surpasses the best 7B code LLMs Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, with only its 1% post-training data. Z1-Coder-7B also achieves 20% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench and 51.4% on BigCodeBench, which performs comparable performance level compared to DeepseekCoder-33B-Instruct (21.5% and 51.1%) and LLaMA3.1-70B-Instruct (19.3% and 54.8 %).

## Fully Open-source: Driving Progress Together
Z1-Coder-7B surpasses the best 7B code LLMs Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, with only 1% its post-training data.
